1. To validate your code against Checkstyle's rules, simply run `gradlew checkstyleStaged` under the root project. It will check your all your staged Java files (`.java` files that have been `git add`) and perform checking. If you didn't staged any Java files, it will check for the Java files that you have modified.
2. If you wish to validate certain project against Checkstyle's rules only, then run it in the specific scope.
