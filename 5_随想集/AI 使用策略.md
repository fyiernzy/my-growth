**Opportunities for AI Agents:**

- Focus on building "vertical AI agents" [[01:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=117)], which are specialized AI agents for specific industries and functions, similar to the success of specialized B2B SaaS companies. [[03:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=182)]
    
- Vertical AI agents have the potential to be 10 times larger than their SaaS counterparts because they can replace both software and the human operators. [[04:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=281)]
    
- To get started, choose a niche where you have domain knowledge [[05:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=337)], identify repetitive and administrative tasks to automate [[05:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=353)], and leverage the advantages of AI agents (24/7 availability, cost-effectiveness, personalization).

- **Prompt Engineering:** This is a high-return-on-investment skill. [[07:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=430)] Prompts for agents need to be clear, detailed, and precise, balancing instructions with flexibility for autonomous behavior. [[07:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=441)] A suggested framework includes defining a role, task, input, output, constraints, and capabilities/reminders. [[08:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=520)]
    
- **Writing Evals (Evaluations):** Essential for measuring an agent's performance. [[10:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=636)] Evals provide a structured way to measure performance across various tasks and scenarios [[10:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=644)], especially for testing edge cases. [[11:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=675)] Common categories include task completion, planning/reasoning quality, tool use accuracy, robustness, and latency/efficiency. [[11:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL5QnLrOjqk&t=683)]

**Framework for Decomposing Business Workflows for Automation:** Observe current processes, decompose them into smaller tasks, map the flow, prototype a simple agentic version, and then evaluate and iterate using evals.

**Presenter's Opinion on Coding:** While coding is needed for AI agent implementation, individuals with strong business/domain knowledge can use no-code tools for prototyping and then hire engineers for implementation
