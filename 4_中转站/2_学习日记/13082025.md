Logging Enhancements

Log both base and source commit SHAs, including their subjects.
Suppress noisy logs (e.g., "Downloading..." and verbose XML output).
Show only the tabular Checkstyle report in final output; if missing, fall back to inline error messages.
Log memory usage and build duration (if applicable).
Summarize the log files being analyzed, grouped by module.

Error Handling Improvements

Make the GitLab Code Quality report optional:
* Reduce retries.
* Attempt to download it, but allow pipeline to pass if it fails after retries.
Resolve caching-related issues.
