TODO 
Fixing traceId at gateway and its context propagation
Fix authentication issue
Perform testing
Fix deployment issue
Dockerfile issue (k8s + add config - I lazy for that day) + preview

Authentication Issue is due to the missing + but not sure why it is
Mask sensitive info
Testing so far smooth
Fix jpa repository & entity scanning issue by using EnableXSupport and annotate them with @EnableJpaRepositories and EntityScan
Fix traceId propagation issue by add configuration (reactor.context-propagation: auto) & add traceId by using AddTraceIdGlobalFilter
Authentication issue: Due to not URL encoded. Must be encoded before use. For postman, just url encode it; from code side, using suitable library for the encoding.
Finish postman collection (oauth2/token + v1/sample only cuz they are more useful; header exist as well)
Finish commit
Fix deployment issue by adding environment variables since trigger manually lack the environment variables
Settle Form


Testing (authentication, security and trace Id - fixing)
Auditing at modular (ApiLog) & OAuth2
Dockerfile + Docker compose (JWKS, other changes)
