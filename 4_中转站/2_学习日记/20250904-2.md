Provide business context from the model itself rather than scatter everywhere, for instance

public enum Status {

	VOID("void"),
	DECEASED("Deceased"),
	PROCESSING("processing"),
	CONFIRMED("confirmed"),
	PENDING("pending"),
	TERMINATED("terminated"),
	BANKRUPT("bankrupt");
}

private static final List<String> activeAccountStatus = new ArrayList<>(
        asList(Status.CONFIRMED.toValue(), Status.BANKRUPT.toValue(), Status.TERMINATED.toValue()));


我自己会偏向在 Enum 里面去定义一个 Active Account Status 然后 Used it in another places so the domain/ vo itself carries business logic, it will be much better lag from my idea

1. What is a Digital Token?
A digital token is like a digital "key" or "ticket" that proves who you are or what you are allowed to do.
* Example: When you log in to an app, instead of keeping your password in memory, the system gives you a "token" that represents your identity for future requests.

2. How is a Digital Token Generated and Used?
* Generated: After you log in (username/password, biometrics, etc.), the server creates a token containing your user info (e.g., ID, roles).
* Used: Every time you call the backend (e.g., /api/data), you send the token instead of typing your password again. The server checks the token and lets you in if it’s valid.

3. Function of a Digital Token and Its Mechanism
* Function: Replace repeated password checks, improve security, and enable stateless communication.
* Mechanism:
    * Commonly uses JWT (JSON Web Token) → a string made of three parts: Header, Payload (user info, expiry time), and Signature (proof it wasn’t tampered with).
    * Server validates the signature with a secret key or public/private key pair.

4. Roles of Frontend and Backend
* Frontend (browser/mobile app):
    * Stores the token (e.g., in memory, cookies, or secure storage).
    * Sends it with each request (Authorization: Bearer <token>).
* Backend (Spring Boot):
    * Generates the token during login.
    * Verifies the token on each request.
    * Grants or denies access based on token validity.


Notes:
- The server issues a token to the client after login.
- The client sends that token with every request to protected resources.
- When client tries to access the protected resources, ~~the server will validate against the token with the one stored in server~~ . 
- The server verifies the signature mathematically to ensure that the token hasn’t been tampered with.
- Once valid, the server extracts the user’s identify and authorities from the token claims and grants access.

Lecture2:
Whoever has a valid JWT can access protected resources, even if they are an attacker.

🔒 Common Mechanisms to Mitigate Token Theft Risks
1. Short Expiration (TTL) + Refresh Tokens
* Mechanism: Access tokens expire quickly (e.g., 15 minutes). A longer-lived refresh token is used to get a new one.
* Benefit: Limits the window of damage if a hacker steals an access token.

2. Secure Storage
* Frontend:
    * Store tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies (not localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS).
    * On mobile, use secure OS storage (Keychain/Keystore).
* Benefit: Reduces exposure to client-side attacks like XSS.

3. Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS)
* Mechanism: Always send tokens over HTTPS.
* Benefit: Prevents attackers from sniffing tokens over the network.

4. Token Binding / Proof of Possession
* Mechanism: Token is tied to the client device via cryptography (public/private key).
* Benefit: Even if stolen, attacker can’t use it without the private key.
* Note: Supported in some advanced setups (OAuth2 “DPoP” or “Mutual TLS”).

5. Audience and Scope Restrictions
* Mechanism: Token includes aud (intended audience) and scope claims.
* Benefit: Prevents token reuse against different APIs or actions.

6. Token Revocation / Blacklisting
* Mechanism: Keep a revocation list (e.g., in Redis). If a token is stolen or user logs out, mark it invalid.
* Benefit: Allows emergency invalidation before expiry.

7. IP / Device / Geo Checking
* Mechanism: Track token usage patterns (IP address, device fingerprint). If unusual, block or re-authenticate.
* Benefit: Detects and stops anomalous usage.

8. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Mechanism: Even if a token is stolen, attacker may also need OTP/biometric.
* Benefit: Adds an extra barrier to token misuse.


Lecture3:
Question:
In case of using 2-Factor Authentication, we can use either biometric + digital token or password + digital token right? It is a practice adopted by Touch N Go, where when a user is trying to make a payment, they have to use either biometric to prove they hold the device, or use password. Using biometric will have a better security as password has the same risks as JWT.

Answer:
2FA means two different categories of proof:
1. Something you know → password, PIN.
2. Something you have → device, security token.
3. Something you are → biometric (fingerprint, face, voice).
To be “true 2FA,” you combine two different categories.

Password + Digital Token (JWT)
* Login with password (something you know).
* Get JWT (something you have — but digital).
* ✅ Yes, this is a common 2FA pattern (used in many banking apps).
Biometric + Digital Token
* Use fingerprint/face scan (something you are).
* Device unlocks/authorizes and sends the JWT (something you have).
* ✅ This is considered stronger, because biometrics are harder to steal than passwords.


Lecture4:
Questions:
Briefly explain the concept of "Bind new device" and "Bind old device" in the digital token context. From what I have understand so far, a digital token should be short-lived token issued to a device temporarily, so there should be no action like "binding" that store the token for a prolong period

Answer:
That’s a sharp observation 👌 — you’re right that digital tokens (JWTs, access tokens, etc.) are short-lived and not meant to be “bound” or stored permanently.
When apps talk about “Bind New Device” / “Bind Old Device”, they’re usually not referring to the token itself, but rather to device registration/trust in the security model.
🔑 Concept of “Binding” in Digital Token Context
1. Bind New Device
* When you log in from a new phone/laptop, the server doesn’t yet trust that device.
* The system performs extra verification (e.g., OTP, biometric, email link).
* After verification, the server “binds” (records) that device ID/fingerprint in your account profile.
* Future tokens issued to that device are considered trusted, so login/payment flows are smoother.
➡️ Think of it as adding a new key to your keychain.

2. Bind Old Device
* When you change devices (e.g., reinstall app, migrate to new phone), the service may allow you to confirm from an already trusted/old device.
* Example: “Approve this login from your old phone” → the old device confirms to the backend that you are legitimate.
* Once approved, the new device becomes trusted and can now receive digital tokens normally.
➡️ Think of it as using an old key to authorize making a duplicate key.

⚡ Where Digital Tokens Fit In
* The short-lived access token (JWT) is still issued to devices only temporarily.
* What’s actually “bound” is the device identity (device fingerprint, public key, or secure credential), not the token itself.
* Binding ensures only trusted devices can receive valid tokens without extra friction.

✅ Summary
* Tokens = short-lived passports.
* Binding = whitelisting the device so it can request passports easily in the future.
* “Bind new device” = add trust to a new device after extra verification.
* “Bind old device” = use an already trusted device to approve the new one.

Lecture5:
Questions: How does the binding is performed? I mean, normally in industry, what attributes will it use for device identification? MAC Address, IP Address, Device Name, or a combination of multiple attributes? If it involves multiple attributes, what are them? Also, will it involve the third parties for verification? Or using solely the attributes mentioned before are sufficient? How the records are usually stored? Stored with account information, or there's a dedicated approach for handling this?
 Answers: 1. Device Identification Attributes
In practice, you rarely rely on just one attribute (like MAC or IP), because those can be spoofed or change easily. Instead, companies use a device fingerprint, which is a combination of multiple attributes.
Common attributes include:
* Device hardware identifiers
    * IMEI (for phones)
    * Serial number (limited use, depends on OS APIs)
    * Secure enclave identifiers (Apple Secure Enclave, Android Keystore)
* OS-level identifiers
    * Device ID (UUID generated by app on first install)
    * Advertising ID (on mobile, though privacy restrictions apply)
* Network info
    * Public IP (unstable, so usually supplementary)
    * Wi-Fi SSID/MAC (less common now due to privacy limits)
* Software/browser info
    * User-agent string
    * Installed fonts, screen resolution (for web “browser fingerprinting”)
* Cryptographic keys (preferred modern method)
    * A keypair generated and stored securely in the device’s keystore.
    * Only the device knows the private key; the server stores the public key.
➡️ Modern best practice: rely on cryptographic binding (device keypair) + some metadata, not just hardware IDs.

2. Third-Party Verification vs Self-Managed
* Self-Managed: Many apps (e.g., banks, fintech, wallets) roll their own device-binding by storing the fingerprint with the account.
* Third-Party Device Intelligence: Some services integrate with Fraud/Device Security vendors (e.g., ThreatMetrix, Riskified, Google SafetyNet, Apple DeviceCheck).
    * These services check if the device is jailbroken, rooted, emulated, or previously linked to fraud.
* Balance: For high-value transactions (like payments), third-party risk services are common. For lower-value or internal apps, self-managed fingerprints are enough.

3. How Records Are Stored
* Usually bound to the account:
    * Example: UserAccount { userId, trustedDevices[] }
* Each entry stores:
    * Device fingerprint (attributes or public key)
    * First seen date
    * Last seen date
    * Trust level (e.g., normal, high risk, blocked)
* Some systems use a dedicated device registry table linked by userId for scalability:
    * DeviceRegistry { deviceId, userId, fingerprintHash, status, metadata }
➡️ Dedicated registry is more scalable because devices can belong to multiple accounts (family devices, shared corporate laptops) and you can centrally manage risk policies.

✅ Summary
* Attributes used: Typically a fingerprint = combination of hardware IDs, OS IDs, app-generated IDs, and increasingly cryptographic keys.
* Third-party verification: Optional but common in finance/commerce for fraud detection.
* Storage: Usually linked to the user account, either inside the account record or in a dedicated device registry table for flexibility and auditing.

⚡ Quick takeaway:
* Old-school → store IMEI/MAC/IP (weak, spoofable).
* Modern industry practice → generate device-bound cryptographic key + metadata fingerprint, and store in a device registry tied to the account.

Lecture6:
Questions: From a backend perspective, to implement a device binding, does it just expose a POST method for receiving all those identifications, including MAC, IP, Crytographic key, etc., and store them only? Or does Backend needs to perform some validation, checking, or request-response process for further verification before storing it? Show me some sample code using plain SpringBoot and Spring Security 6
 Answers:
Great question. No—a secure “device binding” flow is not just “POST whatever identifiers and store them.” In industry, servers usually do a challenge–response (cryptographic proof), optional device attestation/risk checks, and only then persist a trusted device record tied to the account.
Here’s the typical shape:
* Step 1: Start – Server issues a short-lived, random challenge to the authenticated user/device.
* Step 2: Prove possession – Client generates a device keypair in the device keystore and returns:
    * the public key
    * the device metadata (model, OS, app version; avoid relying on MAC/IP)
    * a signature over the server challenge using the device’s private key
    * optionally, a platform attestation (e.g., Android Play Integrity/SafetyNet, Apple DeviceCheck)
* Step 3: Verify – Server verifies the signature (and attestation, if used). If OK, it binds the device by storing the public key + metadata with the user.
* Step 4: Enforce – For future calls, require proof-of-possession (e.g., DPoP-style header or per-request nonce signed by the device key) in addition to the usual access token.
Notes:
* MAC/IP/Device Name are weak or unstable; treat as metadata only.
* Prefer cryptographic binding: the server trusts a device because it can prove possession of the registered private key.
* High-risk flows often add a third-party device attestation or risk engine before binding.

Minimal Spring Boot 3 + Spring Security 6 sample
This is a compact, didactic server-side sketch that shows:
1. a two-step device binding (/device/register/start → /device/register/finish)
2. storing a device with its public key
3. a request filter that enforces proof-of-possession via a simple DPoP header
It intentionally avoids comments and uses your preferences.

How this answers your questions
* The backend does not just “POST and store.” It issues a challenge, demands a signature from a device-held private key, optionally verifies attestation, and only then binds the device.
* Identification is primarily via a device public key plus metadata; MAC/IP are not sufficient.
* Third parties can be involved for attestation/risk in higher-security environments.
* Records are usually stored in a device registry linked to the user, with public key and metadata, timestamps, and status.
If you want, I can extend this to add a short-lived access token flow (JWT with a device_id claim) and show how to require both the bearer token and the DPoP proof on protected endpoints.



Lecture7:
Questions:
Briefly explain the concept of a challenge as I have no idea of cybersecurity. 1. The concept of a challenge, like what it is? A string, a question, or what kind of identifiers? 2. How it is generated. 3. What are the responses to a challenge. How the client can generate that. 4. How does the server verify the attestation. 5. A plantUML that visualizes the whole flow. 6. Answer the question: When the client return the challenge encrypted using private key, how the server make use of this challenge?
 Answers:
1. What is a “Challenge”?
A challenge is basically a random piece of data (often a string of random bytes) that the server sends to the client.
* It’s not a question like in English — it’s just random data.
* Think of it as the server saying: “Prove you are you, by signing this unique string.”

2. How is a Challenge Generated?
* The server uses a cryptographically secure random number generator.
* Example: f39a1c72d9... (a random string/byte sequence).
* It’s unique every time, so an attacker can’t reuse an old answer (“replay attack”).

3. What are the Responses?
* The client has a private key (only it knows).
* It uses that key to sign the challenge (mathematically create a proof).
* The result is a digital signature (another string of bytes).
* Client sends back:
    * Its public key (or reference to it if already stored).
    * The signature (the “response”).

4. How Does the Server Verify?
* Server already knows (or just received) the client’s public key.
* It takes the challenge and the client’s signature, runs math with the public key:
    * If the signature is valid → it proves the client owns the private key.
    * If invalid → reject the request.
Optional: If using device attestation (Apple DeviceCheck, Google Play Integrity), the client also sends a signed “attestation blob” from the OS, which the server validates against Apple/Google. This proves the key lives inside a real device hardware enclave, not an emulator.

6. What Does the Server Do With the Challenge After?
* The challenge itself is just a test string.
* Its purpose is to check: “Can the client really prove it owns the private key, right now?”
* Once verified, the server doesn’t need the challenge anymore.
* The server does not store or reuse it — it only uses it once to confirm proof of possession.
👉 Think of the challenge like a one-time quiz question. The server throws it away after grading the answer.


Lecture8:
Questions: So does it mean if the user attempts to register a new device, the public key will always be accepted as long as it can be used to verify if the signature is valid? So this is merely "public key storing". For more secure mechanism, say DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possesion), each time the user sends to the critical endpoints, the server will respond with a challenge, and the client has to sign that challenge using private key and append it as dpop header; when the request comes with dpop reach the server, the server will extract out the device id to get the public key stored previously, then the server will verify that dpop using public key to verify if it is valid. Isn't it? If yes, show me the whole process using plantuml. also, explain what's the use of the "msg.getBytes()" in this following context: boolean ok = CryptoUtil.verifySignature("SHA256withRSA", pk, msg.getBytes(), sig);
 Answers:
Registration (“public key storing”): The server should only accept a new public key after the client proves possession of the matching private key (by signing a server-issued challenge). That’s not “store anything you send”; it’s verify-then-store.
Per-request proof (DPoP-style): In production DPoP (OAuth draft), the client signs a deterministic message (method, URL, timestamp, jti, etc.), sometimes with a server-provided nonce. Your “server sends challenge each time” is a valid stricter variant (nonce-based PoP). Either way, the server verifies the signature using the previously bound public key.

Notes
* Registration proves you own the private key at bind time.
* Each protected call proves you still own it now and prevents replay (nonce + iat + jti).
* You can replace the explicit nonce step with standard DPoP headers that include a server-provided nonce only when requested; both are acceptable patterns.

Questions: So to clarify, briefly explain the following: 1. The signed string is in fact can be decoded rather than a one-way encryption like bcrypt algorithm, isn't it? 2. For such an asynchronous encryption, there must always be a private key, a public key, a signature (signed message), and a message serving for the "correct answer". Assuming that a device is already binded and its public key is stored, the dpop protection will require client to send the device-id (to lookup the public key), a reference message (a reference message can be composed of request URI, device-id, and public-key), and the reference message that is signed using the private key. When such request arrive at server, the server will lookup the public key, and use the public key to decrypt the content and verify if the contents are matched. Am I correct?
 Answers:
You’ve got the right mental model 🎯 — let’s tighten it up with some precise terms so you don’t confuse “encryption” with “signing”:

1. Signed string vs one-way encryption
* Digital signature ≠ one-way hash/encryption like bcrypt.
* The “signed string” (signature) is not reversible into the original message.
* Instead, the server takes the original message (the reference string, e.g. "POST /transfer") and the signature, then uses the public key to check: 👉 “Was this exact message produced with the matching private key?”
* So, unlike bcrypt, the signature process is verifiable (yes/no), not one-way “stored only” like a password hash.

2. The actors in an asymmetric signature
You nailed it — there are always four pieces in play:
* Private key: stays on device, used to sign.
* Public key: stored by server, used to verify.
* Message: the canonical reference string (e.g. method + URI + nonce).
* Signature: output of sign(privateKey, message).

3. The DPoP flow (simplified with your words)
* Device already bound → server has { deviceId, publicKey }.
* Client sends a request with:
    * device-id header → tells server which key to use.
    * The message (implicit, since it’s the request URI + method + maybe nonce).
    * The signature (DPoP header = message signed with private key).
* Server:
    * Looks up public key for that deviceId.
    * Reconstructs the canonical message from the request.
    * Runs verify(publicKey, signature, message).
    * ✅ If it matches → request is from the real keyholder.
    * ❌ If not → reject.

⚠️ One correction to your phrasing
“server will use the public key to decrypt the content and verify”
🔎 That’s slightly off:
* In digital signatures, the server doesn’t “decrypt.”
* It verifies: the signature is mathematically tied to the message + private key.
* The public key can only say “yes, this signature is valid for this message,” never “decode” the signature into something useful.

✅ In short: You are correct: DPoP = client proves possession of private key by signing a canonical message. Server verifies using stored public key. The signature is not like bcrypt (irreversible hash), and not decryption — it’s a mathematical proof check.

Would you like me to show you a tiny Java snippet (using the earlier CryptoUtil) where I deliberately tamper with the message, so you can see how signature verification fails even if the signature bytes look “decodable”?
