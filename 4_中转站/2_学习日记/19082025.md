From what I know, the main libraries and frameworks for unit testing in Java are JUnit 5, Mockito, and AssertJ—these are the most widely adopted. As an alternative to AssertJ, Hamcrest can also be used. For more complex scenarios, TestNG is another option, but in most cases JUnit 5 is sufficient.
When it comes to more advanced scenarios such as testing AOP features or simulating a series of cases, we can use Spring-level integration tests like @DataJpaTest and @SpringBootTest. These load the Spring ApplicationContext (including dependency injection and the IoC container). They take longer to start up—violating the “fast” principle of unit testing—but they provide significant value for verifying Spring Boot–specific behavior.
For database testing, there are two main strategies. The lightweight option is to mock repositories using Mockito, which keeps dependencies lean. But if we need to test against a real database, we have two choices:
1. Use an H2 in-memory embedded database, which is simple to implement but may not fully reflect production.
2. Use Testcontainers, which allows running real services (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka) in Docker. This avoids polluting the actual database with test data, but it requires Docker setup, which can be a bit tricky.
For controller-level testing, there are multiple options. MockMvc is commonly used, while Karate provides a higher-level, BDD-style approach. I haven’t tried Karate personally, so I can’t confirm its suitability for our use cases.
Other useful testing approaches include load testing (using dedicated tools, not part of unit tests), ArchUnit for validating module dependencies and architectural rules, Awaitility for testing concurrency and asynchronous behavior, and PIT (Pitest) for mutation testing, which ensures our tests are robust by checking how they react to code changes.
To sum up: for unit tests, we should primarily rely on JUnit 5, Mockito, and AssertJ. We can also develop our own utility class (e.g., UnitTestUtil) to help with tricky cases such as testing private methods or mocking static methods (which can be verbose). For non-unit but valuable tests, we can use @SpringBootTest and @DataJpaTest to verify QueryDSL queries and other Spring-related setups.

You’re hitting the classic “self-invocation bypasses the Spring proxy” problem. Call the annotated method through the proxy, not via this. Here are clean, production-friendly fixes—pick one.
1) Inject the proxied self (recommended)
@Service
public class FxService {
  private final FxRateMapper fxRateMapper;
  @Lazy private final FxService self;

  public FxService(FxRateMapper fxRateMapper, @Lazy FxService self) {
    this.fxRateMapper = fxRateMapper;
    this.self = self;
  }

  // e.g., @Transactional / @Cacheable / @Async lives here
  @Cacheable("allFxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { /* ... */ }

  public List<FxSystemRateBean> loadBeans() {
    return fxRateMapper.mapToFxSystemRateBean(self.getAllFxRate());
  }
}
Notes:
* Constructor-inject @Lazy FxService self; Spring will inject the proxy.
* Keep annotated methods public so proxies can intercept.
2) Split into two beans (also recommended)
@Service
public class FxQueryService {
  @Cacheable("allFxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { /* ... */ }
}

@Service
public class FxService {
  private final FxRateMapper fxRateMapper;
  private final FxQueryService fxQueryService;

  public FxService(FxRateMapper fxRateMapper, FxQueryService fxQueryService) {
    this.fxRateMapper = fxRateMapper;
    this.fxQueryService = fxQueryService;
  }

  public List<FxSystemRateBean> loadBeans() {
    return fxRateMapper.mapToFxSystemRateBean(fxQueryService.getAllFxRate());
  }
}
Notes:
* No self-reference needed; the call crosses beans and goes through the proxy.
3) Use the current AOP proxy explicitly (ok for edge cases)
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(exposeProxy = true)
@Configuration
class AopConfig {}

@Service
public class FxService {
  private final FxRateMapper fxRateMapper;

  public FxService(FxRateMapper fxRateMapper) { this.fxRateMapper = fxRateMapper; }

  @Cacheable("allFxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { /* ... */ }

  public List<FxSystemRateBean> loadBeans() {
    FxService proxy = (FxService) AopContext.currentProxy();
    return fxRateMapper.mapToFxSystemRateBean(proxy.getAllFxRate());
  }
}
Notes:
* Requires exposeProxy = true. Avoid overusing; it couples code to AOP.
4) AspectJ weaving (when you must support self-invocation transparently)
Enable AspectJ mode so internal calls are woven too:
@EnableAsync(mode = AdviceMode.ASPECTJ)
@EnableCaching(mode = AdviceMode.ASPECTJ)
@EnableTransactionManagement(mode = AdviceMode.ASPECTJ)
@Configuration
class InfraConfig {}
Notes:
* Needs compile-time or load-time weaving setup. Heavier operationally.

Quick checklist
* Ensure the annotated method is public.
* Ensure proxies are actually enabled: @EnableAsync, @EnableCaching, @EnableTransactionManagement.
* If you use JDK proxies (default with interfaces), inject/call via the interface. If you only have classes, use CGLIB by setting proxyTargetClass = true on the respective @Enable* annotations or use Spring Boot (which defaults to CGLIB for many cases).

Your exact line, fixed (using option 1 or 2)
List<FxSystemRateBean> fxSystemRateBeanList =
    fxRateMapper.mapToFxSystemRateBean(self.getAllFxRate());
// or if split into two beans:
List<FxSystemRateBean> fxSystemRateBeanList =
    fxRateMapper.mapToFxSystemRateBean(fxQueryService.getAllFxRate());
If you tell me which annotation you’re relying on (@Async, @Cacheable, or @Transactional) and how your beans are wired, I can tailor the snippet precisely to your setup.


Great question 👍 — many people confuse git merge and git fetch because both are involved in syncing branches, but they serve very different purposes. Let’s break it down step by step.

🔑 Difference Between git fetch and git merge
git fetch
* What it does: Downloads new commits, branches, and tags from a remote repository into your remote-tracking branches (e.g., origin/main) without touching your local working branch.
* Effect:
    * Your local branch (main) does not change.
    * Only your remote-tracking branch (origin/main) is updated.
* Analogy: Like checking the news — you now know what’s changed in the remote, but you haven’t acted on it yet.
Example:
git fetch origin
After this, your local repo knows the latest commits from origin/main, but your own main branch is still behind until you merge or rebase.

git merge
* What it does: Combines changes from another branch (local or remote-tracking) into your current branch, creating a new commit (unless fast-forward).
* Effect:
    * Your current branch history changes to include the other branch’s commits.
    * May create a merge commit if histories diverged.
* Analogy: Like merging two roads — your branch history now includes both paths.
Example:
git merge origin/main
This takes the commits that were fetched into origin/main and integrates them into your current branch (say main).

🛠️ How to Use Them Correctly
Typical workflow to sync with remote:
1. Fetch first to see what’s changed: git fetch origin
2. 
3. Inspect differences: git log main..origin/main
4.  → Shows commits remote has but your local branch doesn’t.
5. Merge if you want to bring those commits into your branch: git merge origin/main
6.  → Your main is now up to date.

⚖️ How to Decide Which to Use
* Use git fetch when:
    * You want to see what’s new on the remote without changing your working branch.
    * You’re reviewing before pulling changes in.
    * You want to avoid breaking your branch immediately (safe step).
* Use git merge when:
    * You’re ready to integrate another branch’s changes into your current branch.
    * You already fetched changes and decided to apply them.
    * You want to combine your work with teammates’ changes.

🚀 Shortcut: git pull
* git pull is essentially: git fetch + git merge
* 
* But using pull blindly can cause messy merges since you skip the review step.
* Best practice:
    * Use git fetch + inspect differences.
    * Then git merge (or git rebase) intentionally.

✅ Summary:
* git fetch = update my view of the remote, don’t change my branch yet.
* git merge = bring another branch’s commits into my current branch.
* Decide based on whether you want just visibility (fetch) or integration (merge).

Would you like me to also compare git merge vs git rebase (since many teams decide between those when updating from remote)?

(Transactional? Two Transactional can works? Also for @Cacheable)


Here’s a crisp, practical comparison of git merge vs git rebase and how to choose.
What they do
* merge: Creates a new merge commit that ties two histories together. # Bring main into your feature branch
* git checkout feature
* git merge origin/main
*  Result: Preserves the exact history graph (may be non-linear).
* rebase: Rewrites your branch so your commits appear on top of another base. # Replay your feature commits on top of the latest main
* git checkout feature
* git fetch origin
* git rebase origin/main
*  Result: Linear history (clean log), but commit SHAs change.
Pros & cons
	merge	rebase
History shape	Non-linear (shows merges)	Linear (clean, straight line)
Traceability	Keeps true chronology & context	Easier to follow, but history is rewritten
Conflict handling	Once per merge	Possibly multiple times (per commit during rebase)
Safety on shared branches	Safe (no rewrite)	Do not rebase already-pushed shared history
Commit quality	May include noisy merge commits	Can squash/reword for tidy history
Typical speed	One conflict resolution	Can be more work if many commits
When to use which
Choose merge when…
* The branch is already shared/public (others have pulled it).
* You want to preserve the original timeline/context (e.g., long-lived release branches).
* You’re close to release and want the safest, least disruptive integration.
Choose rebase when…
* You’re working on a private/local feature branch and want a clean, linear history.
* You’re syncing with main frequently during development.
* You want to squash/fixup commits before opening a PR.
Two common workflows
A) Keeping a feature branch up to date with main
* Clean & common (private work): git checkout feature
* git fetch origin
* git rebase origin/main            # or: git pull --rebase
*  If conflicts: resolve → git rebase --continue.
* Conservative (team already sharing the branch): git checkout feature
* git merge origin/main
* 
B) Integrating a finished feature into main
* Merge with a merge commit (preserves context): git checkout main
* git fetch origin
* git merge --no-ff feature
* git push
* 
* Rebase then fast-forward (linear history): # Make feature appear as if created on latest main
* git checkout feature
* git fetch origin
* git rebase origin/main
* 
* # Then fast-forward main
* git checkout main
* git merge --ff-only feature
* git push
* 
Golden rules (safe defaults)
1. Never rebase public/shared history. (If others may have pulled it, don’t rewrite it.)
2. Rebase local feature branches; merge shared branches.
3. Prefer git pull --rebase to avoid unnecessary merge commits while you develop: git config --global pull.rebase true
4. 
5. For release/long-lived branches, favor merges for clarity and auditability.
6. Before opening a PR, consider git rebase -i origin/main to squash “WIP” commits.
Quick decision checklist
* Is this branch already pushed and used by others?
    * Yes → MERGE
    * No → REBASE (for clean history)
* Do you need audit-friendly “what merged when” context?
    * Yes → MERGE (often --no-ff)
    * No → REBASE then fast-forward
* Do you want to tidy commits (squash/fixup)?
    * Yes → interactive REBASE
* Are you resolving many conflicts repeatedly?
    * Try MERGE (resolve once), or rebase with --rebase-merges if needed.
If you share your team’s policy (some teams enforce rebase-on-pull, others always merge PRs with --no-ff), I can tailor a one-pager you can drop into your repo’s CONTRIBUTING.md.

Exactly 👍 — but let me unpack it carefully so you know when and why to use @Lazy self-injection for proxy-based annotations like @Cacheable, @Transactional, and @Async.

🔑 Why self-invocation is a problem
* Spring implements these annotations via AOP proxies (JDK or CGLIB).
* Calls made from outside your bean go through the proxy, so the AOP logic (transaction, async, cache) is applied.
* Calls made inside the same bean using this.method() bypass the proxy → the annotations don’t run.
Example (problematic):
@Service
public class FxService {
  @Cacheable("fxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { ... }

  public void doWork() {
    // ❌ Direct self-invocation, bypasses proxy
    List<FxRate> rates = this.getAllFxRate();
  }
}

✅ Common solutions
1. Self-injection with @Lazy (practical & common)
@Service
public class FxService {
  private final FxRateMapper fxRateMapper;
  private final FxService self; // proxy-injected

  public FxService(FxRateMapper fxRateMapper, @Lazy FxService self) {
    this.fxRateMapper = fxRateMapper;
    this.self = self;
  }

  @Cacheable("fxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { ... }

  public void doWork() {
    // ✅ Goes through proxy
    List<FxRate> rates = self.getAllFxRate();
  }
}
* @Lazy avoids circular dependency problems at bean creation time.
* Works with all proxy-driven annotations: @Cacheable, @Transactional, @Async.

2. Split into two beans (cleaner design)
@Service
public class FxQueryService {
  @Cacheable("fxRates")
  public List<FxRate> getAllFxRate() { ... }
}

@Service
public class FxService {
  private final FxRateMapper fxRateMapper;
  private final FxQueryService queryService;

  public FxService(FxRateMapper fxRateMapper, FxQueryService queryService) {
    this.fxRateMapper = fxRateMapper;
    this.queryService = queryService;
  }

  public void doWork() {
    List<FxRate> rates = queryService.getAllFxRate(); // ✅ proxy applies
  }
}
* Often preferable for SRP (separates responsibilities).
* No need for @Lazy or self-reference.

3. Expose proxy (AopContext.currentProxy())
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy(exposeProxy = true)
class AopConfig {}

@Service
public class FxService {
  @Transactional
  public void transactionalMethod() { ... }

  public void doWork() {
    ((FxService) AopContext.currentProxy()).transactionalMethod();
  }
}
* Works, but couples code to Spring AOP internals.
* Best avoided unless absolutely necessary.

4. AspectJ weaving
* If you use AspectJ mode (mode = AdviceMode.ASPECTJ) instead of proxies, self-invocations are also intercepted.
* Powerful but heavier setup (compile-time / load-time weaving).

📝 Rule of thumb
* Yes, @Lazy self-injection is a safe and widely used fix when you want to keep everything in one bean.
* If you’re designing new code, splitting into two beans (caller + callee) often yields cleaner architecture.
* Avoid AopContext.currentProxy() unless you need advanced cases.
* Don’t rely on this.method() if the method is proxy-annotated.

👉 Would you like me to show you a side-by-side before/after example of how @Cacheable fails with this but works with @Lazy self? That way you can see exactly what happens at runtime.


static final class Map1<K,V> extends AbstractImmutableMap<K,V> {
    @Stable
    private final K k0;
    @Stable
    private final V v0;

    Map1(K k0, V v0) {
        this.k0 = Objects.requireNonNull(k0);
        this.v0 = Objects.requireNonNull(v0);
    }

    @Override
    public Set<Map.Entry<K,V>> entrySet() {
        return Set.of(new KeyValueHolder<>(k0, v0));
    }

    @Override
    public V get(Object o) {
        return o.equals(k0) ? v0 : null; // implicit nullcheck of o
    }


Some Map implementation doesn’t throw exception, but some does

Great catch — this is one of those subtle Java concurrency “best practices.”

🔑 Why re-interrupt after catching InterruptedException?
When a thread is interrupted (e.g., another thread calls future.cancel(true) or thread.interrupt()), Java sets the thread’s interrupted status flag (Thread.interrupted internally).
* If you call a blocking method (like Future.get(), Thread.sleep(), BlockingQueue.take()), it reacts by:
    * throwing an InterruptedException,
    * and at the same time clearing the interrupted flag.
So after the exception is caught, the thread’s interrupted status is lost.

✅ Why restore it?
When you do this:
} catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // <-- restore interrupted status
    throw new ServletException(e);
}
You are restoring the interrupted flag so that higher-level code (frameworks, thread pools, other library code) that checks Thread.interrupted() can still see that the thread was interrupted and react properly.
Otherwise, the interruption would be “swallowed” and forgotten.

⚠️ Example without re-interruption
try {
    future.get(); // throws InterruptedException
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // do nothing
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
* At this point, the thread no longer has its interrupt flag set.
* The caller has no way of knowing it was interrupted.
* This can break cooperative cancellation or shutdown logic (like in ExecutorService).

📚 Best practice
1. Either propagate the InterruptedException upwards (preferred in many APIs).
2. Or, if you cannot propagate it (like in servlet code, where the method signature doesn’t allow throws InterruptedException),
    * set the interrupted flag back (Thread.currentThread().interrupt()),
    * then wrap and rethrow in an unchecked exception or checked exception allowed by the method signature.
That way, the interrupt signal isn’t lost.

✅ In your code (ServletException case): Servlet APIs don’t allow throws InterruptedException, so you can’t bubble it up. Re-interrupting ensures that the thread pool (like Tomcat’s worker threads) knows this thread was interrupted, and can decide whether to shut it down, reuse it, or cancel tasks properly.

👉 Do you want me to also show you what happens if you omit the re-interrupt inside a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat thread pool behavior)?

Good evening WeI would like to suggest enhancing the CI/CD process by adding a compilation stage that fails if the compilation does not succeed. I've noticed that the develop/ branch can run into issues when merging multiple branches — especially when, for example, Branch A uses outdated values that have already been updated in Branch B. In such cases, either A or B should be made aware of the changes and make the necessary adjustments. This would help prevent unnecessary or noisy changes that show up during the review of another branch's (e.g., C's) commit.

Example:
https://gitlab.ifastcorp.com/apps/my/ifp/my-ifast-pay/-/blob/develop/my-ifast-pay-backend/util/src/main/java/com/ifast/ipaymy/backend/util/constant/SharedConstant.java?ref_type=heads
https://gitlab.ifastcorp.com/apps/my/ifp/my-ifast-pay/-/blob/develop/my-ifast-pay-backend/util/src/main/java/com/ifast/ipaymy/backend/util/threadpool/ThreadPoolConfig.java?ref_type=heads

ThreadPoolConfig is still using .util.SharedConstant, but SharedConstant is moved to util.constant.SharedConstant

I plan to propose this as a future improvement. What do you think?
